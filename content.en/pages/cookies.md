Cookies Policy
{.subtitle}

**{{% legal name %}}** informs about the use of cookies on its website: **{{% legal web %}}**

## What are cookies?

Cookies are files that can be downloaded to your device through web pages. They are tools that play an essential role in providing numerous services in the information society. Among other things, they allow a website to store and retrieve information about a user's or device's browsing habits and, depending on the information obtained, they can be used to recognize the user and improve the service offered.

In general, these technologies can serve very diverse purposes, such as recognizing you as a user, obtaining information about your browsing habits, or personalizing the way content is displayed. The specific uses we make of these technologies are described below.

## Types and purposes of cookies

According to who manages the domain from where the cookies are sent and processes the data obtained, two types can be distinguished:

- **First-party cookies:** those sent to the user's terminal from a device or domain managed by the editor itself and from which the requested service is provided to the user.
- **Third-party cookies:** those sent to the user's terminal from a device or domain not managed by the editor, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.

If cookies are installed from a device or domain managed by the editor itself, but the information collected through them is managed by a third party, they cannot be considered as first-party cookies.

There is also a second classification according to the length of time they remain stored in the client's browser, which may be:

- **Session cookies:** designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a web page. They are usually used to store information that is only of interest to keep for the provision of the service requested by the user on a single occasion (e.g., a list of purchased products).
- **Persistent cookies:** the data remain stored in the terminal and can be accessed and processed for a period defined by the cookie manager, which can range from a few minutes to several years.

Finally, there is another classification with five types of cookies according to the purpose for which the data obtained is processed:

- **Technical cookies:** those that allow the user to navigate through a web page, platform, or application and use the different options or services existing in it, such as controlling traffic and data communication, identifying the session, accessing restricted access parts, remembering the elements that make up an order, carrying out the purchase process of an order, making the request for registration or participation in an event, using security elements during navigation, storing content for the dissemination of videos or sound, or sharing content through social networks.
- **Personalization cookies:** allow the user to access the service with some predefined general characteristics based on a series of criteria in the user's terminal, such as language, the type of browser through which the service is accessed, the regional configuration from where the service is accessed, etc.
- **Analysis cookies:** allow the person responsible for them to monitor and analyze the behavior of users of the websites to which they are linked. The information collected through this type of cookies is used to measure the activity of websites, applications, or platforms and to create browsing profiles of users of such sites, applications, and platforms, to make improvements based on the analysis of the data usage made by users of the service.
- **Advertising cookies:** allow the management, in the most effective way possible, of advertising spaces. We do not use advertising cookies on this website.
- **Behavioral advertising cookies:** store information on user behavior obtained through continuous observation of their browsing habits, allowing the development of a specific profile to display advertising based on this.
